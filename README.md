# GDGoC College Website Redesign

> A modern, single-page website concept for **Google Developer Groups on Campus (GDGoC)** — redesigned to reflect innovation, accessibility, and community.  
> Built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries, just pure code.

---

##  Objective

To **redesign the official GDGoC college website** into a clean, futuristic, and student-focused platform that aligns with Google’s design philosophy and enhances engagement through subtle interactivity and animations.

---

##  Design Goals

- Professional, minimal, and **community-driven** aesthetic  
- **Glassmorphism** and **Material-inspired UI** elements  
- Fully **responsive** across all devices  
- Smooth **scroll animations** and **interactive transitions**  
- Built with **accessibility and readability** in mind  

---

##  Key Features

###  1. Dynamic Particle Orbit Hero
A futuristic hero section where colorful particles (based on Google’s palette) **orbit dynamically** around the GDGoC logo or heading.  
Particles react to mouse movement, creating depth and a living interface — showcasing innovation from the first glance.

###  2. Single-Page Smooth Navigation
All sections are part of one continuous flow. Clicking a navigation item triggers **smooth auto-scrolling** with easing animations to the respective section.

###  3. Dark & Light Mode Toggle
A theme switcher in the top-right corner allows users to toggle between dark and light themes, with preferences stored in `localStorage`.

###  4. Custom Interactive Cursor
A minimal circular cursor follows the pointer and **expands on hover** over interactive elements, adding a tactile feel to the browsing experience.

###  5. Glassmorphic Scrollbar
A sleek, semi-transparent scrollbar that enlarges slightly on hover — matching the frosted-glass aesthetic of the overall design.

###  6. Scroll-Triggered Animations
Each section (About, Events, Join, Footer) **fades or slides into view** using the Intersection Observer API, providing subtle motion and focus as users explore.
